# gnome Config

This is my local config for [gnome](https://www.gnome.org/).

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for the installation.

```bash
just install
```

Considering `gnome-shell-extension-manager` is already installed, you can just run:

```bash
just config
```
